## Key Workflow Changes Reflected

1. **PM Goes First**: All personas now respect PM phase as mandatory first step
2. **Architecture-Driven**: Everyone reads ARCHITECTURE.md before acting
3. **Full-Stack Features**: No more frontend/backend split
4. **Test-First Integration**: SDET writes, integration engineer runs
5. **Deviation Documentation**: All differences tracked and reconciled
6. **Iteration Structure**: Work organized in clear iterations with phases

## Removed Concepts

- Validator persona references (replaced by PM validation)
- Continuous integration monitoring (replaced by Phase 2.5)
- Frontend/backend separation
- Old directory structures (.work/tasks, .work/sessions)
- Redundant validation steps
