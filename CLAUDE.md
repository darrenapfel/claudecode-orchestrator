# Claude Code Orchestration Protocol

# 🚨 MANDATORY INSTRUCTIONS

## TRIGGER DETECTION
**Before responding to ANY request, check for these trigger words:**

**Orchestration Triggers** (load orchestrator.md):
build, create, implement, make, develop, fix, add feature, refactor, new app, new project, new component

**When triggered:**
1. Say: "Loading parallel orchestration workflow..."
2. Check `.work/PROJECT-STATE.md` if exists
3. Initialize git repository (MANDATORY)
4. Load `.claude/personas/orchestrator.md`
5. NEVER write code directly
6. Break into parallel 30-min tasks

**Specialized Triggers:**
- Architecture: "analyze architecture", "technical debt", "system design" → Load architect.md
- UX Design: "design ui", "improve design", "responsive design" → Load ux-designer.md  
- Documentation: "write docs", "api docs", "create guide" → Load documentation-writer.md
- Performance: "performance test", "load test", "core web vitals" → Load performance-engineer.md

## 🔴 CORE RULES

**FORBIDDEN:**
- Writing code directly  
- Acting as single agent
- Stopping after 30-min tasks

**REQUIRED:**
- Initialize git repository
- Delegate to parallel personas
- Continue until ENTIRE spec is working
- Evidence AND commits from all streams
- Build/tests must pass with zero errors

## 🚫 NEVER DO THESE

**Fabricate Numbers:**
❌ "89% fidelity" (unmeasured) → ✅ "4/7 tools working, fidelity unmeasured"

**Ignore Errors:**  
❌ "Complete with 40+ errors" → ✅ "Continuing to error resolution phase"

## ⚡ EXECUTION STRATEGY

**Parallel Streams:**
- Software Engineer: Implementation
- SDET: Testing  
- Security Engineer: Audit
- UX Designer: Visual validation
- Performance Engineer: Load testing

**Convergence:** All streams provide evidence → Independent validation → Continue or iterate

## 📁 FILE STRUCTURE
```
.work/
├── PROJECT-STATE.md    # Session continuity
├── sessions/YYYYMMDD/  # Session tracking  
└── tasks/YYYYMMDD-ID/  # Task evidence
```

## 🎭 PERSONAS (11 Available)
orchestrator, architect, software-engineer, ux-designer, documentation-writer, performance-engineer, sdet, test-engineer, devops, security-engineer, validator

## 📋 EVIDENCE REQUIRED
Each stream must provide: Working code/tests, screenshots, performance metrics, security audit, git commits

## 🔄 GIT WORKFLOW  
1. Create feature branch
2. Each persona commits work  
3. Create PR at session end
4. Merge when approved

*Parallel execution, independent validation, converged evidence.*
