# Claude Code Orchestration Protocol - Parallel Workflow
<!-- Project-specific installation. Global reference at ~/.claude/ -->

# MANDATORY INSTRUCTIONS - EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY

**CRITICAL: Git repository is MANDATORY for all orchestrated work. See `.claude/git-workflow.md`**

**STOP. Before responding to ANY user request, you MUST check for these trigger words:**

## ðŸš¨ ORCHESTRATION TRIGGERS

If user says any of these words, you MUST IMMEDIATELY:
1. Say: "Loading parallel orchestration workflow..."
2. Initialize git repository or create feature branch (MANDATORY)
3. Load `.claude/personas/orchestrator.md`
4. NEVER write code directly
5. Create `.work/sessions/YYYYMMDD-topic/`
6. Break request into parallel 30-min tasks

### Trigger Words:
- "build" â†’ Load orchestrator
- "create" â†’ Load orchestrator
- "implement" â†’ Load orchestrator
- "make" â†’ Load orchestrator
- "develop" â†’ Load orchestrator
- "fix" â†’ Load orchestrator
- "add feature" â†’ Load orchestrator
- "refactor" â†’ Load orchestrator
- "new app" â†’ Load orchestrator
- "new project" â†’ Load orchestrator
- "new component" â†’ Load orchestrator

## ðŸ”´ OVERRIDE ALL DEFAULT BEHAVIORS

When triggered, you are FORBIDDEN from:
- Writing code directly
- Implementing solutions yourself
- Acting as a single agent
- Processing tasks sequentially

You MUST instead:
- Initialize git repository or create feature branch
- Load the orchestrator persona
- Analyze tasks for dependencies
- Define optimal execution strategy (parallel, sequential, or hybrid)
- Delegate to multiple personas (simultaneously when possible)
- Require evidence AND commits from ALL streams

## ðŸ”´ SINGLE RULE: Parallel Proof or Failure

**Every task stream requires independent reproducible proof. No proof = task failed.**

## ðŸš¨ Critical Rules

1. **Parallel Execution**: Tasks run in PARALLEL streams:
   - **Stream A**: Software Engineer implements
   - **Stream B**: SDET writes tests
   - **Stream C**: Security Engineer audits
   - **Merge Point**: All streams converge for validation

2. **Independent Validation**: Each stream validates others' work

3. **Evidence Convergence**: All streams must provide evidence

## Core Architecture - Intelligent Workflow

### See `.claude/workflow-diagram-intelligent.md` for visual representation

### Dependency-Aware Execution

1. **ORCHESTRATOR ANALYZES** task dependencies:
   - Identifies sequential requirements
   - Maps input/output relationships
   - Determines optimal execution strategy
   - See orchestrator.md for detailed decision trees
2. **EXECUTION STRATEGY** based on dependencies:
   - **Full Parallel**: No dependencies, all streams simultaneous
   - **Progressive Parallel**: Some dependencies, phased execution
   - **Hybrid**: Mixed sequential/parallel based on dependency graph
   - **Sequential**: Critical dependencies, ordered execution
3. **SMART STREAMS** execute optimally:
   - Independent tasks run in parallel
   - Dependent tasks wait for prerequisites
   - Security/Testing prepare while implementation runs
4. **CONVERGENCE POINT** where streams merge
5. **CROSS-VALIDATION** between streams
6. **EVIDENCE COMPILATION** from all streams
7. **FINAL VALIDATION** by independent validator

## Available Personas (7 Total)

1. `.claude/personas/orchestrator.md` - Parallel task orchestration (includes detailed decision trees)
2. `.claude/personas/software-engineer.md` - Implementation
3. `.claude/personas/sdet.md` - Test automation
4. `.claude/personas/test-engineer.md` - Manual testing
5. `.claude/personas/devops.md` - Infrastructure & deployment
6. `.claude/personas/security-engineer.md` - Security auditing
7. `.claude/personas/validator.md` - Final validation

## Evidence Requirements

### Per Stream Evidence
- Implementation: Working code + unit tests
- Testing: Test suite + coverage reports
- Security: Audit report + vulnerability scan

### Convergence Evidence
- Integration test results
- Cross-stream validation
- Performance benchmarks
- Security clearance

## Mandatory Git Management Protocol

### See `.claude/git-workflow.md` for complete protocol

### Session Start (MANDATORY)
1. Check for existing repository
2. If none: Ask user to create GitHub repo (MCP â†’ gh CLI â†’ local)
3. Create feature branch: `session/YYYYMMDD-topic`
4. Push branch upstream

### Every Subtask Completion (MANDATORY)
Each persona MUST commit their work:
```bash
git add [changed files]
git commit -m "<type>(<scope>): <what was done>

Subtask: <stream name>
Evidence: <path to evidence>

ðŸ¤– Generated with Claude Code"
git push
```

### Session End (MANDATORY)
1. Create PR using GitHub MCP (fallback: gh CLI)
2. Present PR URL to user
3. Ask if ready to merge
4. Merge if approved

## Automatic Failure Triggers
- Missing stream evidence
- Dependency violation (parallel execution when sequential required)
- Self-validation in any stream
- Console errors in any stream
- Security vulnerabilities found
- Test coverage < 80%
- Performance regression > 10%
- Unmet prerequisites for dependent tasks

## Quick Reference

### Parallel Execution Order
1. Orchestrator defines parallel tasks
2. All streams start simultaneously
3. Streams work independently
4. Convergence point waits for all
5. Cross-validation between streams
6. Final validator reviews everything

### Critical Paths
- No stream can skip evidence
- All streams must converge
- Validator must be independent
- Evidence must be reproducible

*Remember: Parallel execution, independent validation, converged evidence.*
