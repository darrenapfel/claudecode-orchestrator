# Orchestrator v3.9: Automatic Continuation & Integration Fixes

## Problems Addressed

1. **Premature Stopping**: Orchestrator stopped at 85% complete despite having clear path to fix remaining issues
2. **Auth System Failure**: Frontend/backend built incompatible auth (GET vs POST) that passed initial reviews
3. **Perverse Incentives**: Binary success/failure forced dishonesty when facing legitimate constraints

## Key Changes

### 1. Automatic Continuation Protocol (orchestrator.md)
- Added COMPLETION CRITERIA section
- NEVER STOP if: fixable issues + clear path + no blockers
- ONLY STOP when: 100% complete OR blocked OR unclear path
- Auto-create Phase N+1 when validation fails but fix possible

### 2. Integration Contract Requirements (architect.md)
- Must specify exact API formats (POST for auth, not GET)
- Required deliverables include integration contracts
- "How will frontend submit data?" must be answered
- Security requirements explicit, not assumed

### 3. Data Flow Validator (integration-engineer.md)
- Complete overhaul - now tests ACTUAL data flow
- Must submit real forms, capture real requests
- Continuous integration every 2-3 tasks
- VETO power to halt on mismatches

### 4. Constrained Success Recognition (validator.md)
- Added "WORKS WITH CONSTRAINTS" outcome
- Examples: needs API key, requires SSL cert
- Prevents false dichotomy of success vs failure
- Allows honest external dependency reporting

### 5. Security Veto Authority (security-engineer.md)
- Auth security checklist with instant halt triggers
- GET request with password = STOP
- Full authority to force fix phases
- Explicit list of critical violations

### 6. Implementation Guardrails (software-engineer.md)
- Required implementation checklist
- Must reference architecture docs
- Auth-specific: NEVER credentials in URLs
- Evidence must include compliance checks

### 7. Orchestrator Empowerment (orchestrator.md)
- Authority to STOP bad implementations
- Can demand architecture revision
- Can create unplanned review cycles
- Override timeline for quality/security

## Result

These surgical changes address:
- Orchestrator stopping despite ability to continue
- Auth system built wrong due to missing contracts
- Integration engineer rubber-stamping without testing
- Pressure to claim 100% when 85% + constraints is honest

The system now:
1. Continues automatically when fixes are possible
2. Catches integration mismatches during development
3. Allows honest constraint reporting
4. Empowers veto power for critical issues
