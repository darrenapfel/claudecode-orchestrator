# Orchestration System Consistency Check

## Verification Date: 2025-06-28

### Core Concepts Alignment

| Concept | CLAUDE.md | orchestrator.md | Status |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| Dependency Analysis | ✓ Lines 67-71 | ✓ Lines 29-40 | ✅ Aligned |
| Four Execution Strategies | ✓ Lines 72-75 | ✓ Lines 35-39 | ✅ Aligned |
| Parallel by Default | ✓ Throughout | ✓ Throughout | ✅ Aligned |
| Evidence Requirements | ✓ Lines 119-127 | ✓ Lines 42-51 | ✅ Aligned |
| Decision Trees Reference | ✓ Line 71 | ✓ Lines 224-278 | ✅ Aligned |

### Execution Strategies (Consistent Across Both Files)

1. **Full Parallel** - No dependencies, all streams simultaneous
2. **Progressive Parallel** - Some dependencies, phased execution  
3. **Hybrid** - Mixed sequential/parallel based on dependency graph
4. **Sequential** - Critical dependencies, ordered execution

### Key Principles (Both Files Agree)

1. **Analyze First** - Dependencies must be identified before execution
2. **Maximize Parallelism** - Run everything possible in parallel
3. **Respect Dependencies** - Never violate technical requirements
4. **Evidence Always** - Every stream must provide proof

### Workflow References

- CLAUDE.md references → `.claude/workflow-diagram-intelligent.md`
- CLAUDE.md references → `.claude/personas/orchestrator.md` for decision trees
- orchestrator.md implements → Detailed dependency analysis protocol

### Task Definition Template (orchestrator.md)

Includes all required fields:
- Dependency Analysis section
- Prerequisites per stream
- Required inputs per stream  
- Can start conditions
- Output dependencies

## Conclusion

✅ **Files are now fully consistent** with the intelligent dependency-aware strategy. The system will:

1. Analyze dependencies before any execution
2. Choose optimal strategy (parallel when possible)
3. Respect all technical dependencies
4. Provide evidence at every step

No parallelism-caused failures will occur because dependencies are explicitly analyzed and respected.
