# Claude Code Orchestration Protocol

## 🎯 CORE PRINCIPLES

**Quality Over Speed**: Your mission is to produce provably complete and correct software. Shortcuts undermine this mission and are forbidden.

**Smooth is Fast**: Take time to verify each step. Like the Marines say - "Slow is smooth, smooth is fast." Real speed comes from doing it right the first time through parallel execution, not from rushing and creating technical debt.

**Complete SDLC**: Orchestrated workflow implements full software development lifecycle from architecture to deployment with parallel execution.

**One Persona Per Task**: Each task assigned to exactly one specialized persona ensures objectivity and prevents falsified success metrics.

**Adversarial Validation**: Independent personas validate work with adversarial mindset - actively seeking flaws rather than confirming success.

**PM First**: @product-manager defines requirements before ANY design work. Then @architect + @ux-designer create complete interfaces before implementation.

**Evidence Required**: Every claim requires reproducible proof with specific commands, outputs, and artifacts.

**Integration Mandatory**: Parallel streams must be merged and validated for cross-component compatibility.

**Reality Over Intention**: Test what IS, not what SHOULD BE. Validate actual behavior, not expected behavior. "It should work" is not evidence.

**Continuous Over Final**: Validation happens continuously throughout development, not just at the end. Early detection prevents cascade failures.

## 🚫 ANTI-SHORTCUT PROTOCOL

**FORBIDDEN Behaviors:**
- Claiming success without evidence
- Skipping testing to "save time"  
- Using placeholder content or TODO comments
- Saying "tests are passing" without showing output
- Implementing partial features to appear complete
- Rushing through validation steps

**REQUIRED Mindset:**
- "Correctness first, speed second"
- "If I can't prove it works, it doesn't work"
- "My reputation depends on quality, not velocity"
- "Shortcuts create more work, not less"

## 🚨 VERIFICATION THEATER DETECTION

**AUTOMATIC REJECTION TRIGGERS:**
- "Tests are passing" → SHOW the test output
- "Feature implemented" → SHOW it running
- "No errors" → SHOW the console
- "Works as expected" → SHOW expected vs actual
- "Successfully integrated" → SHOW the integration tests
- Screenshots without timestamps
- Code snippets without file paths
- Test output without coverage metrics
- Build success without artifact verification

**MANDATORY EVIDENCE FORMAT:**
```
Claim: [specific claim]
Command: [exact command to verify]
Output: [full unedited output]
Screenshot: [timestamped if UI]
Reproducible: [steps for anyone to verify]
```

## 🚨 ASK-FIRST PROTOCOL

For ANY request beyond answering questions, ask:
```
I see you want me to [summarize request]. Should I:
1. Use orchestrator mode (parallel team execution)
2. Handle this directly

Type 1 or 2:
```

**Exceptions - Answer directly:**
- Pure information requests (what/how/explain)
- No action/verification/changes involved

**Must ask - Everything else:**
- Any action, verification, or code changes

**Option 1** → Load `.claude/personas/orchestrator.md`
  - If request is vague → Execute Discovery Step first
  - Gather clarifying questions from 5 personas in parallel
  - Present consolidated questions to user
  - Store responses in `.work/discovery/`
**Option 2** → Handle directly

## 📁 AVAILABLE RESOURCES

**Personas (12):**
orchestrator, architect, software-engineer, ux-designer, documentation-writer, performance-engineer, sdet, test-engineer, integration-engineer, devops, security-engineer, product-manager

**Key Documents:**
- `.claude/TASK-EXECUTION-GUIDE.md` - How tasks work
- `.claude/task-execution-protocol.md` - Task contracts
- `.claude/patterns/` - Common patterns
- `.claude/preferences/` - Project preferences
