# Foundation Directory

This directory contains the foundational documents created during Phase 0 by the three required personas.

## Structure

```
foundation/
├── architecture/    # @architect - System design documents
├── ux/             # @ux-designer - User flows and wireframes
└── product/        # @product-manager - User stories and acceptance criteria
```

## Purpose

All three subdirectories must be populated with evidence before any implementation can begin. This ensures:
- Technical feasibility (architecture)
- User experience design (ux)
- Clear requirements (product)

## Important

These documents form the foundation for all subsequent work. Changes to these documents after Phase 0 require orchestrator approval and may trigger rework.
