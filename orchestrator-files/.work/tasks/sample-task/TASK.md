# Task: Add User Authentication System

**ID**: 20250702-1430-user-auth
**Scope**: Implement secure user authentication
**Assigned**: @software-engineer
**Dependencies**: None

## Baseline Metrics
- Tests: 45/50 passing
- Coverage: 78%
- Build: passing
- Bundle size: 1.2MB
- Response time: <300ms

## Success Criteria
- [ ] User registration with email validation
- [ ] Login with bcrypt password hashing  
- [ ] JWT token generation and validation
- [ ] Logout endpoint invalidates tokens
- [ ] Password reset via email
- [ ] Rate limiting (10 req/min per IP)
- [ ] Tests maintain baseline (50/50 passing)
- [ ] Coverage increases to >85%
- [ ] Evidence documented with screenshots
- [ ] Git commit created
- [ ] Checkpoint validation PASS

## Technical Requirements
- Use bcrypt (cost factor 12)
- JWT expires in 1 hour
- Refresh tokens valid 7 days
- Email templates for reset flow
- Redis for token blacklist
- Proper error messages (no info leakage)

## Architecture Compliance
- Follow existing auth patterns
- Use established middleware
- Integrate with current user model
- Maintain RESTful conventions
- Security-first approach

## Evidence Requirements
Create in .work/tasks/[this-task-id]/:
- INTERFACE.md with all endpoints
- EVIDENCE.md with test results
- artifacts/screenshots/ with UI proof
- artifacts/test-output/ with coverage

## Validation Notes
Different persona must verify:
- All endpoints work as documented
- Security requirements met
- No sensitive data in logs
- Rate limiting effective
- Tests are comprehensive
