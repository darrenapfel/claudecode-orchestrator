## Security Evidence
**Persona**: @security-engineer  
**Status**: ‚è≥ Pending

### Security Audit Results
```
Expected format:
üîç OWASP Top 10 Compliance: PASS/FAIL
üîç SQL Injection: PROTECTED
üîç XSS Protection: ENABLED
üîç Rate Limiting: CONFIGURED
üîç Secure Headers: IMPLEMENTED
üîç Password Policy: ENFORCED

Critical Issues: 0
High Issues: 0
Medium Issues: X
Low Issues: X
```

### Vulnerability Scan
```
Expected format:
Tool: npm audit / Snyk
Critical: 0
High: 0  
Medium: X
Low: X

All critical and high vulnerabilities must be resolved.
```

### Security Checklist
- [ ] Passwords properly hashed with bcrypt
- [ ] JWT tokens use secure secrets
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents brute force
- [ ] Input validation prevents injection
- [ ] Secure HTTP headers configured
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs
- [ ] Session management secure

## Integration Evidence
**Persona**: Multiple (convergence point)
**Status**: ‚è≥ Pending

### End-to-End Test Results
```
Expected format:
User Journey Tests:
‚úÖ Complete registration flow: PASS
‚úÖ Login with valid credentials: PASS  
‚úÖ Login with invalid credentials: FAIL (expected)
‚úÖ Password reset flow: PASS
‚úÖ Session expiration handling: PASS
‚úÖ Rate limiting behavior: PASS

Total E2E Tests: XX/XX passing
```

### Performance Benchmarks
```
Expected format:
Concurrent Users: 100
Duration: 5 minutes
Success Rate: XX% (target >99.9%)
Average Response: XXXms (target <200ms)
95th Percentile: XXXms (target <500ms)
```

## Reproduction Steps
*Each persona must provide exact steps to reproduce their results*

### How to Test Implementation
1. Clone repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Set environment variables (see .env.example)
4. Run `npm run test`
5. Start server: `npm run dev`
6. Test endpoints with provided Postman collection

### How to Verify Security
1. Run security scan: `npm audit`
2. Run OWASP ZAP scan on running server
3. Review audit report in `./security-audit.pdf`
4. Verify rate limiting: `artillery run load-test.yml`
