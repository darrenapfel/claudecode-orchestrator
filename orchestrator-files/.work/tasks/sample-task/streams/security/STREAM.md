# Security Stream: User Authentication

**Persona**: @security-engineer
**Stream ID**: SEC-AUTH-001
**Parent Task**: SAMPLE-AUTH-2024
**Status**: ðŸ”´ Not Started

## Stream Responsibilities
- Conduct comprehensive security audit of authentication system
- Verify OWASP Top 10 compliance
- Perform vulnerability scanning and penetration testing
- Validate security best practices implementation
- Provide security recommendations and risk assessment

## Security Audit Plan

### Phase 1: Code Review (30 min)
1. Review password hashing implementation
2. Analyze JWT token generation and validation
3. Check input validation and sanitization
4. Verify secure HTTP headers configuration
5. Review session management implementation

### Phase 2: Vulnerability Assessment (30 min)
1. Run automated vulnerability scans
2. Test for SQL injection vulnerabilities
3. Test for XSS vulnerabilities
4. Test for authentication bypass attempts
5. Verify rate limiting effectiveness

### Phase 3: Penetration Testing (30 min)
1. Attempt brute force attacks on login
2. Test session fixation vulnerabilities
3. Test for privilege escalation
4. Verify secure password reset flow
5. Test CSRF protection mechanisms

### Phase 4: Compliance & Reporting (15 min)
1. OWASP Top 10 compliance checklist
2. Generate security audit report
3. Document findings and recommendations
4. Prepare evidence package

## Security Checklist

### A01: Broken Access Control
- [ ] JWT tokens properly validated on protected routes
- [ ] User can only access own resources
- [ ] Admin functions properly protected
- [ ] No privilege escalation possible

### A02: Cryptographic Failures
- [ ] Passwords hashed with bcrypt (min 12 rounds)
- [ ] JWT tokens use strong secret keys
- [ ] No sensitive data transmitted in plain text
- [ ] TLS/HTTPS enforced for all endpoints

### A03: Injection
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- [ ] Input validation on all endpoints
- [ ] XSS prevention (output encoding)
- [ ] Command injection prevention

### A05: Security Misconfiguration
- [ ] Secure HTTP headers configured
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive info
- [ ] Default credentials changed
- [ ] Unnecessary features disabled

### A07: Identification and Authentication Failures
- [ ] Strong password policy enforced
- [ ] Account lockout after failed attempts
- [ ] Session management secure
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication support

## Vulnerability Tests

### Authentication Bypass
- Test for SQL injection in login forms
- Test for authentication bypass with malformed tokens
- Test for session fixation vulnerabilities
- Test for brute force protection effectiveness

### Token Security
- Verify JWT secret strength and randomness
- Test token expiration handling
- Test token signature validation
- Test for token replay attacks

### Input Validation
- Test all endpoints with malicious payloads
- Verify XSS protection on user inputs
- Test for buffer overflow vulnerabilities
- Verify file upload restrictions (if applicable)

## Deliverables Checklist
- [ ] Complete security audit report
- [ ] Vulnerability scan results
- [ ] Penetration testing results
- [ ] OWASP Top 10 compliance report
- [ ] Risk assessment and recommendations
- [ ] Security best practices validation
- [ ] Remediation plan for any issues found

## Success Criteria
- Zero critical or high-severity vulnerabilities
- OWASP Top 10 compliance achieved
- All security best practices implemented
- Rate limiting effectively prevents attacks
- Secure password and session management
- No sensitive data exposure
- All security tests passing

## Dependencies
- **Incoming**: Implementation stream (needs code to audit)
- **Outgoing**: Testing stream (cross-validation)
- **Concurrent**: Can prepare security test scenarios while implementation develops

## Evidence Requirements
Must provide in streams/security/evidence/:
1. Security audit report (PDF)
2. Vulnerability scan results
3. Penetration testing results
4. OWASP compliance checklist
5. Risk assessment document
6. Security recommendations
7. Remediation tracking
