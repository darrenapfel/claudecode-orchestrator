# Claude Code Orchestration System v5.0.0

A comprehensive orchestration framework that enables Claude Code to operate as a full software development team through parallel execution, structured workflows, and evidence-based validation.

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

**Quality Through Truth**: The system enforces honest development practices where every claim requires evidence, every test result must be shown, and validation failures are documented and fixed rather than hidden. This approach paradoxically saves tokens by catching issues early rather than building on broken foundations.

## ✨ What's New in v5.0.0

### 🚀 Milestone Completion Protocol
- **Service Startup & Validation**: Services are started and smoke-tested before declaring completion
- **User Testing Materials**: Auto-generated testing guides from user stories
- **Human Feedback Loop**: Structured feedback collection and processing
- **Live Deployment**: Milestones end with running, accessible services

### ⚡ Enhanced Parallel Execution
- **Visual Execution Guides**: Clear indicators for parallel vs sequential tasks
- **Parallel Execution Detector**: System-level warnings against sequential execution
- **One Message Rule**: Multiple independent tasks MUST be created simultaneously

### 🔒 Global Install Protection
- **Confirmation Prompts**: Prevents accidental overwrite of global configurations
- **Safe Defaults**: Cancels on any input except explicit 'y' confirmation

### 📚 Documentation Improvements
- **Single Source of Truth**: Master reference documents eliminate contradictions
- **Organized Structure**: Guides separated from patterns for clarity
- **Quick References**: Fast access to common commands and paths

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Global Installation (Recommended)
```bash
# Install globally for use across all projects
./orchestrator.sh global
# ⚠️ WARNING: This will replace ~/.claude/claude.md - confirm carefully!

# Then in any project:
./orchestrator.sh local
```

### Local Installation Only
```bash
# Install directly in current project
./orchestrator.sh local
```

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Parallel Execution Model
The orchestrator manages multiple specialized personas working simultaneously:

```
FOUNDATION STEP
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  ⚡ PARALLEL: ONE MESSAGE - BOTH TASKS TOGETHER! ⚡      ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
├── Task: @architect - Design architecture
└── Task: @ux-designer - Create user flows
```

### Milestone-Based Development
Work is organized into major development phases with service delivery:

```
.work/
├── milestones/
│   └── 20250105-user-authentication/
│       ├── sprint-001/
│       │   ├── tasks/
│       │   ├── integration/
│       │   ├── validation-1/
│       │   ├── fixes/cycle-1/
│       │   ├── validation-2/
│       │   └── completion/
│       │       ├── MILESTONE-COMPLETION.md
│       │       ├── USER-STORIES-TESTING-GUIDE.md
│       │       └── USER-FEEDBACK-FORM.md
│       └── milestone-completion-summary.md
└── foundation/
    ├── architecture/
    ├── product/
    └── ux/
```

### Git Integration
Every validated task is automatically committed with file isolation:

- **Task-level commits**: Each task commits only its specific files
- **Orchestrator announces**: All git actions visible in chat
- **File tracking**: Prevents cross-contamination between parallel work
- **Integration commits**: Connect separate features cleanly

## 🎉 Milestone Completion Process

### 1. Service Startup & Validation
When a milestone completes, the system:
- Starts the service in the background
- Validates endpoints are responding
- Runs smoke tests to ensure basic functionality
- Provides the running URL to the user

### 2. User Testing Materials
Automatically generates three documents:
- **MILESTONE-COMPLETION.md**: Overview and testing instructions
- **USER-STORIES-TESTING-GUIDE.md**: Test scenarios from original requirements
- **USER-FEEDBACK-FORM.md**: Structured feedback collection

### 3. Human Feedback Loop
```
User: "The login button is hard to find"
System: Creates feedback sprint → Implements fix → Re-validates → Updates service
```

### 4. Completion Announcement
```
🎉 MILESTONE [Authentication System] COMPLETE - Service Running & Ready for Testing

✅ VALIDATION: All validators passed
✅ SERVICE: Running and validated at http://localhost:3000
✅ DOCUMENTATION: All testing materials prepared

🎯 USER TESTING - READY NOW:
   ✅ Service URL: http://localhost:3000 (already running)
   📖 Test scenarios: See USER-STORIES-TESTING-GUIDE.md
   📝 Report issues: Fill out USER-FEEDBACK-FORM.md
   🔄 Submit feedback: "Please process the user feedback file"

Just open http://localhost:3000 and start testing!
```

## 📋 Key Features

### Evidence-Based Development
- Every task produces EVIDENCE.md with reproducible proof
- Test outputs must be complete, not summarized
- Screenshots require timestamps
- Commands must show actual execution

### Fix Cycle Protocol
- Validation failures trigger fix cycles (normal and expected)
- Each fix cycle is documented and committed
- Multiple cycles show honest development progress
- Success is achieving 100% pass, not avoiding failures

### Master Reference Documents
- `MASTER-DIRECTORY-STRUCTURE.md` - Single source of truth for organization
- `GIT-COMMIT-STRATEGY.md` - Authoritative git workflow
- `PARALLEL-EXECUTION-GUIDE.md` - Visual guide to parallel execution

## 👥 Available Personas

```

## 🔍 Validation Process

Four validators work in parallel to ensure quality:

1. **Product Manager** - Validates user stories work end-to-end
2. **Test Engineer** - Runs comprehensive test suites & service startup
3. **Performance Engineer** - Checks speed and scalability
4. **Security Engineer** - Validates security compliance

Any validation failure triggers fix cycles until all pass.

## 💡 Best Practices

### For Maximum Effectiveness

1. **Trust the Process** - Multiple fix cycles are normal, not failures
2. **Let Services Run** - Milestones deliver running software, not just code
3. **Provide Feedback** - Use the structured feedback forms for improvements
4. **Review Evidence** - Check the `.work/` directory to see actual outputs
5. **Watch Git Actions** - All commits are announced in chat

### Common Patterns

- **New Project**: Discovery → Full implementation → Running service
- **Add Feature**: Skip discovery → Start at requirements → Update service
- **Fix Bugs**: Create fix tasks → Validate thoroughly → Deploy fixes
- **User Feedback**: Process feedback form → Sprint for fixes → Re-validate

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Service Won't Start
- Check logs in `.work/milestones/*/sprint-*/completion/service.log`
- Verify all dependencies installed
- Test engineer will diagnose and create fix tasks

### Parallel Execution Issues
- Look for "Let me create the first task..." - this indicates sequential execution
- Check PARALLEL-EXECUTION-GUIDE.md for visual examples
- Orchestrator should create ALL independent tasks in ONE message

### Git Conflicts
- Orchestrator tracks file ownership to prevent conflicts
- Integration commits handle shared file updates
- Check GIT-TROUBLESHOOTING.md for solutions
