# Claude Code Orchestrator v2.1 🎭

**Transform Claude into an intelligent, parallel software development organization** - with dependency-aware execution, built-in security auditing, DevOps automation, and evidence-based delivery.

## 🚀 What is Claude Orchestrator?

Claude Orchestrator v2 is an advanced framework that enables Claude Code to operate as a complete, **parallel-executing** software development team. By implementing intelligent dependency analysis, specialized personas, and mandatory evidence collection, it delivers enterprise-grade software with unprecedented reliability - even in 24-hour autonomous coding sessions.

### Key Innovation: Intelligent Parallel Execution

Unlike sequential approaches, v2 introduces **dependency-aware parallel execution**:
- **Orchestrator**: Analyzes dependencies and chooses optimal execution strategy
- **Software Engineer**: Implements features with production-ready code
- **SDET**: Writes comprehensive test suites in parallel with development
- **Security Engineer**: Performs real-time security audits and threat modeling [NEW]
- **Validator**: Provides adversarial validation across all streams
- **DevOps**: Automates deployment with guided, interactive workflows [ENHANCED]
- **Test Engineer**: Executes manual testing from user perspective

## 🧠 New in v2: Intelligent Execution Strategies

### Dependency-Aware Task Management
The orchestrator now analyzes task dependencies and automatically selects the optimal execution strategy:

1. **Full Parallel** - No dependencies, all streams run simultaneously
2. **Progressive Parallel** - Some dependencies, phased execution
3. **Hybrid** - Mixed sequential/parallel based on dependency graph
4. **Sequential** - Critical dependencies require ordered execution

### Example: Building an Authentication System
```
User Request: "Build secure authentication with MFA"
    ↓
Orchestrator analyzes:
- Database schema needed first (Sequential)
- API and Frontend can then run in parallel
- Security audit runs alongside implementation
- Tests written concurrently with code
    ↓
Result: 3x faster delivery with zero conflicts
```

## 💡 Why Claude Orchestrator v2?

### The Problem with v1
While v1 introduced personas and evidence, it still had limitations:
- Sequential execution wasted time
- No built-in security considerations
- Limited deployment guidance
- Manual dependency management

### The v2 Solution
Claude Orchestrator v2 delivers:
- **Intelligent parallelism** - 3-10x faster execution
- **Built-in security** - Every feature audited in real-time
- **Guided deployment** - Interactive DevOps workflows
- **Zero conflicts** - Dependency analysis prevents issues
- **Production-ready** - Security, tests, and deployment from day one

## 🎯 Benefits

- **10x faster delivery** - Parallel execution with dependency awareness
- **Enterprise security** - Built-in threat modeling and security controls
- **Zero-touch deployment** - Guided CI/CD pipeline creation
- **Guaranteed working code** - Multi-stream validation
- **24-hour autonomous coding** - Reliable even in extended sessions

### For Projects
- **Bank-grade security** - OWASP Top 10, SOC2 ready
- **95%+ test coverage** - Parallel test development
- **Production-ready** - Deployment pipelines included
- **Complete documentation** - Every decision tracked
- **Compliance ready** - GDPR, HIPAA considerations built-in

chmod +x orchestrator.sh

# Run interactive installer
./orchestrator.sh

# Choose:
# 1) Global installation (~/.claude) - For all projects
# 2) Local installation (./.claude) - For current project only
```

### Post-Installation
```bash
# For global installation
source ~/.claude/aliases.sh
echo "source ~/.claude/aliases.sh" >> ~/.bashrc

# Initialize any project
cd your-project
claude-init
```

### Project Setup
```bash
# In any project directory
claude-init

# Or manually
~/.claude/init-project.sh
```

```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Tech Stack
Configure your stack in `.claude/preferences/tech-stacks/`:
- Next.js 14+ with TypeScript
- Supabase backend
- Tailwind CSS
- Jest + Playwright testing

### Git Workflow
Automatic session management:
```bash
# Start of session
git checkout -b session/YYYYMMDD-feature

# After each task
git commit -m "feat: implement login
- Added auth endpoints
- 95% test coverage
- Evidence: .work/tasks/*/EVIDENCE.md"

# End of session
gh pr create
```

## 🎮 Usage

### Starting a Session
```markdown
Load ~/.claude/personas/orchestrator.md

I need to build a user authentication system with email/password login,
JWT tokens, and password reset functionality.
```

### Claude's Response
```markdown
## Task Breakdown

### TASK-001: Authentication API Endpoints
**Assigned to**: @software-engineer
**Duration**: 30 minutes
**Exit Criteria**:
- POST /api/register endpoint
- POST /api/login endpoint  
- Tests with 80%+ coverage
- Response time < 200ms
```

### Evidence Example
Every task produces evidence in `.work/tasks/*/EVIDENCE.md`:
```markdown
# Task Evidence: Authentication API
**Generated**: 2024-01-15T10:30:45Z
**Exit Criteria**: ✅ ALL PASSED

## Test Results
PASS tests/auth.test.ts
✓ registers new users (87ms)
✓ prevents duplicate emails (12ms)
✓ validates passwords (95ms)
Coverage: 92.3%

## API Verification
$ curl -X POST localhost:3000/api/register
{"id":"usr_123","email":"test@example.com"}
Response time: 126ms ✅
```

## 🚦 How Parallel Execution Works

1. **Orchestrator** analyzes dependencies and creates execution plan
2. **Multiple streams** start simultaneously when safe
3. **Implementation** builds features
4. **Testing** creates tests in parallel
5. **Security** audits in real-time
6. **Convergence** point validates all streams
7. **Evidence** compiled from all parallel work

## 🛡️ Quality Guarantees

- **No Placeholders**: Automatic rejection of TODOs, mocks, Lorem ipsum
- **Real Testing**: Actual test execution, not just test files
- **Working Code**: Screenshots and reproduction commands required
- **Adversarial Validation**: Different persona must verify claims
