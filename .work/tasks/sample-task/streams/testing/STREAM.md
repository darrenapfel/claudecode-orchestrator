# Testing Stream: User Authentication

**Persona**: @sdet
**Stream ID**: TEST-AUTH-001
**Parent Task**: SAMPLE-AUTH-2024
**Status**: ðŸ”´ Not Started

## Stream Responsibilities
- Design comprehensive test strategy for authentication system
- Implement integration tests for all API endpoints
- Create load testing scenarios
- Validate error handling and edge cases
- Generate coverage reports and performance metrics

## Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Test Planning (15 min)
1. Analyze implementation requirements
2. Design test cases for each endpoint
3. Identify edge cases and error scenarios
4. Plan load testing scenarios

### Phase 2: Integration Testing (45 min)
1. Set up test environment with test database
2. Write integration tests for registration flow
3. Write integration tests for login/logout flow
4. Write integration tests for password reset flow
5. Test JWT token lifecycle (creation, validation, refresh, expiry)
6. Test rate limiting behavior

### Phase 3: Load & Performance Testing (30 min)
1. Create load testing scripts with Artillery
2. Test concurrent user registration
3. Test concurrent login attempts
4. Measure response times under load
5. Validate rate limiting under stress

### Phase 4: Reporting (15 min)
1. Generate test coverage reports
2. Document performance benchmarks
3. Create test result summary
4. Prepare evidence package

## Test Scenarios

### Registration Tests
- Valid registration with all required fields
- Registration with duplicate email (should fail)
- Registration with invalid email format (should fail)
- Registration with weak password (should fail)
- Registration with missing fields (should fail)

### Login Tests
- Login with valid credentials (should succeed)
- Login with invalid email (should fail)
- Login with invalid password (should fail)
- Login after multiple failed attempts (should be rate limited)
- Login with expired session (should require re-authentication)

### Token Management Tests
- JWT token generation and structure validation
- Token validation with valid token (should succeed)
- Token validation with expired token (should fail)
- Token validation with invalid signature (should fail)
- Token refresh functionality

### Security Tests
- Rate limiting on registration endpoint
- Rate limiting on login endpoint
- SQL injection attempts (should be blocked)
- XSS payload attempts (should be sanitized)
- Password brute force prevention

## Deliverables Checklist
- [ ] Complete integration test suite
- [ ] Load testing scenarios and results
- [ ] API endpoint validation tests
- [ ] Error handling verification tests
- [ ] Security vulnerability tests
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Test coverage report (>90% target)
- [ ] Test execution documentation

## Success Criteria
- All integration tests passing
- Load tests show acceptable performance (<200ms avg)
- Error scenarios properly handled
- Security tests pass (no vulnerabilities)
- Test coverage >90%
- Performance benchmarks met
- All edge cases covered

## Dependencies
- **Incoming**: Implementation stream (needs working endpoints)
- **Outgoing**: Security stream (cross-validation)
- **Concurrent**: Can prepare test scenarios while implementation develops

## Evidence Requirements
Must provide in streams/testing/evidence/:
1. Test execution results
2. Coverage reports
3. Performance benchmark data
4. Load testing results
5. Security test results
6. Test case documentation
