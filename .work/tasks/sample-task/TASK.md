# Task: Add User Authentication System

## Task ID: SAMPLE-AUTH-2024
**Estimated Duration**: 90 minutes (3 x 30min parallel streams)
**Priority**: High
**Dependencies**: None (initial feature)

## Objective
Implement a secure user authentication system with registration, login, logout, and session management.

## Exit Criteria (Must ALL be met)
- [ ] User registration with email validation
- [ ] Secure login with password hashing
- [ ] Session management with JWT tokens
- [ ] Password reset functionality
- [ ] Rate limiting on auth endpoints
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (>90%)
- [ ] Security audit completed with no critical issues
- [ ] All endpoints documented with examples
- [ ] Evidence of working system with screenshots

## Execution Strategy: PARALLEL
**Streams run simultaneously with planned convergence**

### Stream Dependencies
```
Prerequisites: None (initial implementation)
Implementation → Testing (needs endpoints to test)
Implementation → Security (needs code to audit)
Testing ← Security (cross-validation required)
```

## Technical Requirements

### Implementation Stream
- Framework: Express.js + TypeScript
- Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- Password hashing: bcrypt
- JWT tokens for sessions
- Input validation: Zod
- Email service: SendGrid or Nodemailer

### Testing Stream
- Unit tests: Jest
- Integration tests: Supertest
- API testing: Postman/Newman
- Load testing: Artillery
- Coverage target: >90%

### Security Stream
- OWASP compliance check
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- Rate limiting implementation
- Secure header configuration
- Vulnerability scanning

## Validation Criteria
Each stream must provide evidence:
1. **Implementation**: Working endpoints + unit tests
2. **Testing**: Test suite results + coverage report
3. **Security**: Audit report + vulnerability scan
4. **Integration**: E2E test results + performance metrics

## Risk Assessment
- **High**: Password security implementation
- **Medium**: JWT token management
- **Low**: Email validation flow

## Success Metrics
- All tests passing
- Security scan clean
- Performance: <200ms response time
- Error rate: <0.1%
